A great place to store my collection of droids salvaged from the Jundland Wastes!

Oh, ok. I think I now see how this is supposed to work. I cloned the repository that I set up so that I 
have a local copy here on my computer hard drive. Now I can edit the text file that I created with this
plain text editor and when I am finished I can push this to the Git repository.

Now to see if it actually works...stand by.
